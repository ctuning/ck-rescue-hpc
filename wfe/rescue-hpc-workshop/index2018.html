<h2>Introduction</h2>

Experiment reproducibility and artifact sharing is gradually
becoming a norm for publications at HPC conferences. 

<p>
However, our recent experience to validate experimental results 
during artifact evaluation (AE) at at PPoPP, CGO, PACT, CLUSTER 
and SuperComputing also highlighted multiple problems. 

Ad-hoc experimental workflows, lack of common experimental
methodology and tools, and the ever changing software/hardware
stack all place a heavy burden on evaluators when installing,
running and analyzing complex experiments. 

Worse still, even when artifacts (e.g. benchmarks, data sets, models) 
are shared, they are typically difficult to customize, port, reuse
and build upon. 

<p>
Establishing common experimental workflow frameworks with common 
formats/APIs and portable package managers can considerably 
simplify validation and reuse of experimental results.

ResCuE-HPC is a multidisiplinary workshop bringing together 
HPC researchers and practitioners from academia and industry
interested in discussing and developing 
common experimental methodologies, workflow frameworks 
and package managers for reproducible and reusable HPC.

<!------------------------------------------------>
<h2>Topics of interest</h2>

We invite position papers (up to 4 pages) presenting novel 
or existing practical solutions to:

<ul>
<li> unify, automate and scale artifact evaluation at HPC conferences;

<li> share artifacts (workloads, benchmarks, data sets, models,
  tools), workflows and experiments in a portable, customizable 
  and reusable way;

<li> automatically and natively install and rebuild all software
  dependencies required for shared experimental workflows
  on different machines and environments;

<li> automatically report and visualize experimental
  results including interactive articles to assist reproducible
  initiative at SC and other conferences and journals;

<li> continuously validate experiments from the past research
  and report/record unexpected behavior (bugs, numerical
  instability, variation of empirical results such as execution
  time or energy measurements, etc) on new and evolving software and hardware stack;

<li> establish open repositories of common benchmarks, data
  sets and tools to accelerate knowledge exchange between
  HPC centers;

<li> enable universal, customizable and multi-objective autotuning
  and co-design of HPC software and hardware in a reproducible
  and reusable way;

<li> unify statistical analysis and predictive
  modeling techniques to improve reproducibility of empirical
  experimental results;

</ul>

We also encourage submissions demonstrating practical use-cases
of portable, customizable and reusable HPC workflows based on existing 
experimental frameworks and package managers 
including but not limited to <b><a href="http://cknowledge.org">Collective Knowledge</a></b>
and <b><a href="https://spack.io">Spack</a></b>.

<p>
Authors of accepted papers will have an opportunity to introduce
their techniques (10..15 minutes) and then participate 
in an open discussion panel at the workshop. 

<p>
There will be no formal proceedings for the first edition 
of this workshop to encourage on-site discussions! 
Instead, all ResCuE-HPC authors will be able to participate 
in preparation of the ResCuE-HPC report while trying to gradually 
converge on a common experimental methodology and possible formats 
for workflows and artifact sharing (meta information and API).

We plan to make this report available to reproducibility 
and artifact evaluation chairs at SC, PPoPP, PACT, CGO and 
to the ACM taskforce on reproducibility where we are founding members.

<p>
We hope that ResCuE-HPC workshop will help the community 
to gradually converge on a common experimental methodology and possible formats 
for workflows and artifact sharing (meta information and API).

This, in turn, should help our community quickly prototype research ideas 
and thus dramatically accelerate development of the next generation 
of HPC software and hardware while reusing all prior work.
