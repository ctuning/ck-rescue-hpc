<!--------------------------------------------------->
Over the past 5 years we have initiated <a href="http://cTuning.org/ae">Artifact Evaluation initiative (AE)</a>
at several premier conferences on parallel programming, architecture and code generation
including PPoPP, PACT, CGO, IA3, SC.

AE aims at encouraging researchers to share code,
data and experimental workflows along with their published papers
to let the community independently validate their experimental results.

<p>
The good news is that our community takes reproducibility initiative
very seriously - nowadays nearly half of accepted papers submit artifacts.

<p>
The bad news is that nearly all research artifacts (e.g. benchmarks, data sets, tools, models)
and experimental workflows are shared in some ad-hoc formats thus placing a heavy burden 
on evaluators when installing, running and reproducing complex experiments.

Even when publicly available, such artifacts can rarely be easily reused, customized
and ported to other platforms.

<p>
Though the community started developing various tools 
to solve above problems (<b><a href="http://github.com/ctuning/ck">Collective Knowledge</a></b>,
<b><a href="http:/spack.io">spack</a></b>, and so on), these efforts could greatly benefit from
joint coordination.

<p>
We organize this workshop to bring together HPC researchers
and practitioners who are interested in developing
reproducible, portable and customizable experimental workflows
for HPC.

We are particularly interested in contributions that describe
state-of-the-art, pitfalls, comparisons and improvements
to existing frameworks, benchmarks and datasets that can be
used to run HPC workloads across multiple software versions
and hardware architectures.

Another aim of the workshop is to gather all this information
in order to propose methodologies for reusing prior artifacts
and accelerating the development of the next generation of HPC 
software and hardware.

<!--------------------------------------------------->
<h2>Scope</h2>

The ResCuE-HPC workshop will discuss in detail requirements,
design and implementation of reproducible, portable and customizable
experimental workflows to simplify and accelerate exploitation
of novel ideas in HPC.

<p>
Such workflow frameworks must be able to <i>capture</i>,
<i>share</i> and <i>accurately</i> replicate, replay and
reproduce results from prior work in order to quickly
validate, reuse, customize and build upon them (To
make scientific breakthroughs it is necessary to be able
to stand on the shoulders of giants, if we paraphrase Isaac
Newton).

Therefore topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

<ul>

<li> sharing artifacts (workloads, benchmarks, data sets, models,
  tools), workflows and experiments in a customizable and
  reusable way;

<li> automatically and natively installing or rebuilding all software
  dependencies required for shared experimental workflows
  on different machines and environments;

<li> automatically reporting and visualization of experimental
  results including interactive articles to assist reproducible
  initiative at SC;

<li> continuously validating experiments from the past research
  and report/record unexpected behavior (bugs, numerical
  instability, variation of empirical results such as execution
  time or energy measurements, etc) on new and evolving software and hardware stack;

<li> establishing open repositories of common benchmarks, data
  sets, tools and to accelerate knowledge exchange between
  supercomputing centers;

<li> investigating various statistical analysis and predictive
  modeling techniques to improve reproducibility of empirical
  experimental results.

</ul>

<!--------------------------------------------------->
<h2>Expected outcome</h2>

We plan to write a summary report after this workshop
describing useful or novel ways to share, customize and reuse HPC artifacts 
(such as benchmarks, data sets, models, tools, etc), workflows
and experiments that will be published together with accepted
papers in the proceedings.

<p>
Any outstanding issues reported at the workshop and the summary report 
will be used to update the scope of the future editions of this workshop!

We will also make this report available to reproducibility 
and artifact evaluation chairs at SC, PPoPP, PACT, CGO and 
to the ACM taskforce on reproducibility where we are founding members.

<p>
All ResCuE-HPC authors will be able to participate 
in preparation of this report while trying to gradually 
converge on a common experimental methodology and possible formats 
for workflows and artifact sharing (meta information and API).

We hope that such a practical approach will help the community 
to gradually converge on a common experimental methodology and possible formats 
for workflows and artifact sharing (meta information and API).

This, in turn, should help our community quickly prototype research ideas 
and thus dramatically accelerate development of the next generation 
of HPC software and hardware while reusing all prior work.
